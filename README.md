# Poker Buy-In Tracker (Auto DB)

This project is a simple poker buy-in tracker (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL). It **auto-creates the database tables on startup**, so you don't need to run migrations manually.

Features:
- Add players, mark inactive/reactivate
- Add buy-ins (chips) and returns
- Show total bank value, total chips by color, money in play
- Round Reset (clear chip counts), Full Reset (clear everything)
- Mobile-first UI

See steps.txt for easy deployment steps.
